-Random Quote Generator-

My first project written in React. It utilizes the fetch API to GET an array of quotes/authors parsed as JSON.

On initial mount to the DOM and on user generated click input it generates a random index within range set by length of quote array.
State of local quote-box component is used to store current quote and author for rendering

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
